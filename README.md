To run repox:

* copy ./ansible/my-vars.default.yml onto ./ansible/my-vars.yml
* make sure nothing is listening on port 8080
* run vagrant up
* open localhost:8080 in a web browser
* log in with username "admin" and password also "admin"
 * What's that?  You changed those?  Good.  Use the new credentials you created.
